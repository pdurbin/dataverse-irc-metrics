# Dataverse IRC metrics

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pdurbin/dataverse-irc-metrics/master)

http://chat.dataverse.org is a way for the Dataverse community to communicate in real time and catch up conversations through logs at http://irclog.iq.harvard.edu/dataverse/today

This repo contains a Jupyter Notebook to analyze the chat logs. It can be launched using the "launch binder" button.

It was used in Philip Durbin's [Jupyter Notebooks and crazy ideas for Dataverse](https://scholar.harvard.edu/pdurbin/blog/2019/jupyter-notebooks-and-crazy-ideas-for-dataverse) talk for the [2019 Dataverse Community Meeting](https://dataverse.org/events).
